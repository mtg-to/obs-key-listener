Dear User!

The installer has created a launcher in your Start Menu and you might have chosen to install a desktop shortcut.

You must "Run as Administrator" for this application to work as expected!

If you'd like to experiment with the capabilities, which you're very welcome to do, you can execute the application from the commandline and tweak the parameters.

To obtain detailed usage information you can open a console, navigate to your installation directory and launch:

"listener.exe -h"
